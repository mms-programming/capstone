# Capstone project

This repository is for all of my work for the udacity machine learning nanodegree capstone. 

My work is broken up into three main notebooks: 

**Final-Capstone-EDA.ipynb**: This notebook showcases all of the exploratory data analysis I conducted for this project
**Final-Capstone-Modeling.ipynb**: This notebook showcases all of the modeling work I did in order to create my final solution 
**Final-Capstone-PostModelingAnalysis.ipynb**: This notebook showcases all the additional work I did after creating my final solution. This includes things such as perturbation analysis and free form visualizations 

Additionally, I have also included my submission outputs, which is stored in the data folder. The submissions for my three model iterations are stored in first_model_prediction.csv, second_model_prediction.csv, and third_model_prediction.csv respectively. The ten submissions I used to create a distribution to determine whether my model is statistically significant is stored in the stat-sig directory inside the data directory.
